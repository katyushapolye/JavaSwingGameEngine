The JSGE frame-work is designed to teach basic concepts from more powerful and well-established game engines, as well
as to give the user a general idea of how OOP is applied in Game Programing and Software development in general.

## Main Features

- Fully Flexible Renderer, Supporting multiples Sprites with a bunch of options for transforming said Sprites on the run.
- Basic Collision System.
- Basic Input Handling Capability, Stearing away from Java's Swing Event Oriented Programming.
- A Basic Game Demo.
